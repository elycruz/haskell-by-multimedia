 			 Haskore Music System
			 --------------------

This is the February 2000 release of Haskore (updated in 2007 and 2014
for API changes), available from:

  http://haskell.org/haskore

This version improves on the previous release through limited support
for Csound (thanks to Matt Zamec), the very popular computer music
package written as a pre-procesor to C.  This support comes in two
forms:

-- There is a translator from Haskore to Csound score files, thus
   providing another platform besides Midi on which to experience
   your compositions.

-- You can design new instruments, in the style of Csound's orchestra
   files, using a special data type in Haskore.  A translator then
   converts this data type into a Csound orchestra file.  Currently
   support is provided for the basic synthesis elements --
   oscillators, delay lines, basic filters, and basic effects --
   but it is easy to add more of the (hundreds of) Csound primitives
   if one desires.

For more details, see Section 12 of the Tutorial.

Haskore can also now be used under both latest Hugs (2006 version
with -98 option) and GHC (version 6.6).

The best way to use the system with Hugs is to drop the entire Haskore
directory into Hugs/lib (replacing the one that's there).  All of the
files except this README file are in the directory Src.

Important files in the distribution:

1) "Haskore.lhs" will load the entire basic Haskore system.  If your
   Hugs has the proper paths set up, once you drop this directory into
   Hugs/lib, you should be able to just say "import Haskore" and
   everything should work correctly.
2) Loading "HaskoreExamples.lhs" loads the above plus several other
   modules containing useful demonstrations of "Haskore in Action".
3) "tutorial.tex" is the root of the Haskore Tutorial, a literate
   script that imports most other files in the directory.  
   "turorial.ps" is the postscript version of this.

This release builds upon the November 1998 version, which improved
over previous releases in several ways:

  1) You can now read MIDI files and convert them into Music values.
  2) There is good support for percussion, based on the General Midi
     percussion standard.
  3) There are a number of new higher-level music constructions, the
     most notable being functions for trills, and a parallel
     composition operator that truncates the result to the shortest of
     the two inputs.
  4) A change in the underlying type for Durations, from Float to
     Ratio Integer.  This is the only incompatible change.
  5) Lots of code improvements.
